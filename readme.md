# Introduction

In the fiercely competitive telecommunications industry, customer retention holds equal significance to customer acquisition. SyriaTel, currently grappling with escalating customer churn, aims to employ data-driven insights to comprehensively grasp and alleviate the factors contributing to customer attrition. This analysis navigates the intricacies of customer behavior, service utilization, and interaction patterns to unveil the underlying causes of churn. The goal is to pinpoint vulnerable customers and the elements influencing their departure, proposing precise strategies to boost satisfaction, nurture loyalty, and ultimately curtail churn. SyriaTel envisions that this initiative will fortify its market standing, redefining its customer relationship management approach and setting a new benchmark for telecommunications service excellence.



# Problem Statement

SyriaTel faces a critical challenge in retaining its customer base, with an upward trend in customer churn. This churn not only impacts the company's revenue but also escalates the expenses associated with acquiring new customers to maintain market share. The identification of factors contributing to churn and the prediction of at-risk customers empower SyriaTel to implement focused retention strategies, fostering customer loyalty and mitigating turnover.

This analysis scrutinizes the patterns and predictors of customer churn at SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications provider. Leveraging customer usage data, service plans, and interaction history, we employ statistical analysis and machine learning models to discern the primary drivers of churn. The study aims to segment the customer base, assess the impact of diverse service features on customer retention, and construct a predictive model to pinpoint at-risk customers. The analysis outcomes guide targeted interventions geared towards enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, reducing churn rates, and nurturing sustained business growth.



# Objectives

1.	Identifying Churn Factors: Understand the factors contributing to customer churn by analyzing data on customer behavior, service usage, and interaction patterns.

2.	Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict which customers are at risk of churning. This involves using historical data to create models that can anticipate future customer behavior.

3.	Improve the model using hyperparameter tuning to increase its accuracy.




# Technologies Used

1.	Python

2.	Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly, imbalanced-learn

3.	Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

4.	Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV

5.	Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly




# Dataset

The analysis utilizes a telecommunications dataset containing information on customer attributes, service plans, and interaction history.




# Methodology

1.	Data Understanding: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify missing values, and address outliers.

2.	Feature Engineering: Removal of irrelevant features, handling multicollinearity, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

3.	Data Scaling: Scaling of numerical features to ensure consistent model performance.

4.	Handling Class Imbalance: Employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the 'churn' feature.

5.	Modeling: Utilized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for predictive modeling.

6.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuned hyperparameters for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to optimize performance.

7.	Model Comparison: Evaluated models based on ROC curves, F1 scores, and accuracy.

8.	Insights and Recommendations: Derived insights from feature importance and model evaluations to guide strategies for customer retention.




# Results and Insights

Gradient Boosting Classifier, with tuned hyperparameters, demonstrated superior performance in predicting customer churn.
Identified high-value customer segments, prioritized retention efforts based on churn risk, and provided personalized service recommendations.




# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Gradient Boosting Classifier, with tuned hyperparameters, is recommended for predicting customer churn in the telecom dataset. By acting on the insights gained from feature importance and model evaluations, the telecom company can implement targeted strategies to minimize churn and enhance customer satisfaction.



# Recommendations

Customer Segmentation for Revenue Maximization: Identify high-value customers by analyzing their usage patterns, plan subscriptions, and service calls. Tailor strategies to retain these customers who significantly contribute to revenue.

Risk-Based Prioritization: Segment customers based on churn risk to prioritize retention efforts. Target high-risk customers with personalized campaigns to reduce the likelihood of churn.

Optimizing Service Offerings: Analyze peak vs. off-peak usage patterns to guide promotional offers or adjustments in service plans, enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

Customized Service Utilization: Understand how different services (voice, international, voicemail) influence churn to tailor service offerings based on customer preferences and needs.

Feedback-Driven Improvement: High numbers of customer service calls may indicate areas for service improvement. Analyze the reasons behind these calls to address specific pain points.

Holistic Customer Feedback: Incorporate customer feedback through surveys or feedback mechanisms for qualitative insights that complement quantitative findings from the dataset.
